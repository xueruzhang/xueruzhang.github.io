<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at The Ohio State University. </p>

<p>	My research focuses on the <strong>societal aspects</strong> of machine learning and algorithmic decision-making. I aim to (1) understand the societal implications of machine learning, and (2) develop algorithms that are aligned with social norms (e.g., privacy, fairness, interpretability) and reliable under social dynamics. I study these problems using approaches from machine learning, statistics, optimization, game theory, and economics. For more details, please see my <a href="/rs/rs.pdf">research statement</a> and <a href="/publication/">publications</a>. </p>

<p>	Prior to joining OSU, I completed my PhD in August 2021 under the supervision of <a href="https://liu.engin.umich.edu/">Mingyan Liu</a> at the University of Michigan.
