<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at The Ohio State University. I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://tdai.osu.edu/">Translational Data Analytics Institute</a> and <a href="https://moritzlaw.osu.edu/CRAIG">Center on Responsible AI and Governance</a>.</p>

<p>At OSU,	I lead the <strong><a href="/student/">Ethical and Trustworthy Human-Intelligent Computing (ETHIC) Lab</a></strong>, where we advance the <strong>theoretical and algorithmic foundations of trustworthy machine learning</strong> in high-stakes, dynamic, multi-agent, and human-interactive environments.  This includes (1) understanding the  <em>societal and economic impacts</em> of ML systems; (2) developing principled methods that enhance algorithmic <em>fairness, privacy, robustness, safety, interpretability, and alignment with human values</em>; and (3) designing <em>steering and incentive mechanisms</em> that guide multi-agent and human-ML interactions toward socially beneficial outcomes. These efforts have broad interdisciplinary impact across healthcare, earth sciences, finance, transportation, and social domains.</p>

Our research is generously supported by the National Science Foundation, Cisco, Center for Clinical and Translational Science, and Nationwide Children's Hospital, and OSU Translational Data Analytics Institute.</p>

<p>	Prior to joining OSU, I completed my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://liu.engin.umich.edu/">Mingyan Liu</a> at the University of Michigan.
