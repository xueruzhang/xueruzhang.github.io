<p>I am a PhD student in the department of <a href="https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a> at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. <a href="https://liu.engin.umich.edu/">Mingyan Liu</a>. I received my M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Michigan in 2016, and B.Eng. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Beihang University (BUAA), Beijing, China, in 2015.

<br><br>My research focuses on the <strong>societal aspects</strong> of machine learning and algorithmic decision-making, especially in the areas of <i><b>privacy</b></i>, <i><b>security</b></i>, and <i><b>fairness</b></i>. I study these problems using approaches from machine learning, statistics, optimization, game theory, and economics.
